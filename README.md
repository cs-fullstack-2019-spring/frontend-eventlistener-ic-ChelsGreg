### Problem 1:
Create a h1 element with "Teacher". Next create a button with "Next". Given the array ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin] iterate through the names when the button is clicked.

### Problem 2:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Make a button in the main section that can add a “*” to a p element and change the background color to yellow each time it's pressed. Once it's yellow it would stay yellow.

### Problem 3:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture and make all the background colors yellow. Put one button in each section. Using only one function, click each button to change the associated background of the clicked button to purple.
